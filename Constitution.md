# The CONstitution of the CONsortium

### 🤔Preamble

🤔We, the members of the CONsortium, having resolved to ensure long-lasting consensus of moderation, perpetuate burocracy, and formalize schenanigans, do hereby adopt and commit to upholding this CONstitution.

### 🤡Members

🤡TODO::What even are members?

### 💰Fungibles

* 💰🤲Fungibles are indivisible units of currency that may be useful for other purposes.

* 💰💥Fungibles can not be created or destroyed.

* 💰🙎‍♀️Fungibles are owned by persons. Fungibles may also be owned by bots, legal fictions, or other non-persons if authorized by a simple motion or greater.

#### 💰🤑Types

💰🤑 The only kinds of fungibles are:

* Political Capital (PC),
* Generators (Gens), and
* StatusBux (sb)

#### 💰✈️Protection from transfer

💰✈️👌 If the owner of a fungible is a person, that fungible may not be transferred or destroyed without the explicit consent of that person. Making an action to cast a vote counts as explicit consent to remove the necessary PC to cast that vote. Making an action to create a motion counts as explicit consent to cast the necessary vote(s) and thus remove the necessary PC to cast those vote(s).

💰✈️🤖If the owner of a fungible is a {bot, legal fiction, or other non-person}, then that fungible may not be transferred or destroyed except as authorized by a simple motion or greater.

#### 💰👤Privacy of fungibles

💰👤📈The amount of fungibles owned by a person (their balance) is private, and must not be revealed without their explicit consent.

💰👤🤖The amount of fungibles owned by a {bot, legal fiction, or other non-person} is private, and can only be revealed as authorized in a simple motion or greater.

💰👤👀The transactions that an entity has participated in are private, and must not be revealed unless:

* 💰👤👀🗳The transaction is a vote on a motion,
* 💰👤👀👌At least one party has given explicit consent (if that party is a person), OR
* 💰👤👀✔️It is authorized by a simple motion or greater (ONLY if at least one party is a {bot, legal fiction, or other non-person})

💰👤👁️The above protections shall not be construed to {prohibit or restrict} public {transfers or fabrication} of fungibles, even if such {transfers or fabrication} may in effect reveal details about an entity's {balances or transactions}.

### 📜Motions

📜🤔A motion is a proposed action to be taken by the CONsortium as an entity in theory, and once passed allows members to take action to implement it in practice. This includes but is not limited to:

* 📜🤔✔️Adopting new rules
* 📜🤔⚙️Making changes to the discord server
* 📜🤔💸Fabricating, transferring, and/or destroying fungibles
* 📜🤔🗣️Declarations
* 📜🤔📋Adopting administrative procedures, OR
* 📜🤔📝Changing the constitution.

📜2️⃣There are two kinds of motions:

* 📜2️⃣👶Simple motions, which 
  * 📜2️⃣👶👐require more than half of the votes on that motion to be in favor AND
  * 📜2️⃣👶👶are limited in that they are less powerful than the constitution. Simple motions cannot ammend the constitution. Simple motions cannot override the constitution, and in the case of any contradiction between a simple motion and the constitution in text and/or in effect, the constitution shall take precedence.
* 📜2️⃣💥Super motions, which
  * 📜2️⃣💥🌊require more than two-thirds of the votes on that motion to be in favor AND
  * 📜2️⃣💥🌟are not at all limited. Super motions can do anything once passed, including but not limited to ammending or overriding the constitution.

📜🔢A motion is first Proposed, then voted on, then possibly Passed. A motion can not have any effect before it is passed.

#### 📜🗣️Calling motions

📜🗣️👽All members have the inalienable right to call motions if they have enough pc to do so and have not exceeded their daily limit.

📜🗣️❔Each member is limited to 10 motions of any kind each UTC day.

📜🗣️👶To call a simple motion, a member must have enough PC to vote for that motion at least **once**. When called, they do and must vote for that motion at least **once**.

📜🗣️💥To call a super motion, a member must have enough PC to vote for that motion at least **twice**. When called, they do and must vote for that motion at least **twice**.

#### 📜🗳Voting on motions

📜🗳👽All members have the inalienable right to vote on pending motions if they have enough pc to do so.

📜🗳📈A member can not change the "direction" (in favor or against) of their vote after their first vote, including 0-votes.

📜🗳💲Each member's first vote on each motion costs 40 PC. The cost of each additional vote by that member is 40 * 1.05^N rounded down, where N is the number of votes that member has already cast on that measure.

📜🗳📰Who voted on a motion, in which direction, when, and how many votes shall be a matter of public record.

#### 📜🔚End of a motion

📜🔚A motion ends when the motion's potential result (pass or fail based on the number of votes) hasn't changed for 48 hours. At that moment, the motion can no longer be voted on, and goes into effect if it passes.

### 🔢Order of precedence

🔢The law and prescribed actions of the CONsortium are the whole sum of the constitution and all passed motions, taken together. Sections of the constitution and/or sections of motions ("texts") may contradict eachother; If so then the first applicable bullet point below resolves the contradiction.

* 🔢💥{Super motions and the constitution} take precedence over simple motions
* 🔢🗣️If a text says it overrides the other (or other similar phrasing) but not vice-versa, then it does.
* 🔢⏲️The text that passed later overrides the text that was passed earlier.

### Default interpretations

In case of any vagueness or simple lack of mentioning, the following defaults apply. This does not prohibit motions from explicitly specifying a different meaning.

* If a time of day is mentioned, it is assumed to be in Pacific Time as used by the state of Washington
* If a motion depends on when a message was "posted" or "sent" or similar, it is assumed to be the timestamp assigned to the message by discord, obtainable by extracting it from the snowflake ID.
* A motion that is phrased as changing some state of the universe is assumed to mean the CONsortium shall take action to make that change happen.
* A supermotion that does things not allowed by the constitution implicitly ammends the constitution to allow it to do those things, in the minimal amount posible.

### Override votes

A unanimous vote of Shelvacu, Ben, and Colin can do anything a super motion can do, and does so immediately as soon as all three votes are made in favor.

### Supreme Leaders

The only members with the title of "Supreme Leader" are Shelvacu, Ben, and Matt.

### The Transition

This constitution wholly replaces the previous constitution.

All {fungibles, motions, and transactions} and history thereof shall continue existing unless otherwise stated.
