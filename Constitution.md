# The CONstitution of the CONsortium

### Fungibles

Fungibles are indivisible units of currency that may be useful for other purposes.

Fungibles can not be created or destroyed.

Fungibles are owned by persons. Fungibles may also be owned by bots, legal fictions, or other non-persons if authorized by a simple motion or greater.

#### Types

The only kinds of fungibles are:

* Political Capital (PC),
* Generators (Gens), and
* StatusBux (sb)

#### Protection from transfer

If the owner of a fungible is a person, that fungible may not be transferred or destroyed without the explicit consent of that person. Making an action to cast a vote counts as explicit consent.

If the owner of a fungible is a {bot, legal fiction, or other non-person}, then that fungible may not be transferred or destroyed except as authorized by a simple motion or greater.

#### Privacy of fungibles

The amount of fungibles owned by a person (their balance) is private, and must not be revealed without their explicit consent.

The amount of fungibles owned by a {bot, legal fiction, or other non-person} is private, and can only be revealed as authorized in a simple motion or greater.

The transactions that an entity has participated in are private, and must not be revealed unless:

* At least one party has given explicit consent (if that party is a person), or
* It is authorized by a simple motion or greater (ONLY if at least one party is a {bot, legal fiction, or other non-person})

The above protections shall not be construed to {prohibit or restrict} public {transfers or fabrication} of fungibles, even if such {transfers or fabrication} may in effect reveal details about an entity's {balances or transactions}.

### Motions

A motion is a proposed {action to be taken or rule to be created}.

Any person with the requisite PC can call a motion
